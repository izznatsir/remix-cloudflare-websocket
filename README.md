## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
pnpm dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
pnpm build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
pnpm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

Make sure to deploy the output of `pnpm build`

-   `build/server`
-   `build/client`
